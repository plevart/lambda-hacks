/**
 * One or more variables that together maintain a running {@code double}
 * value updated using a supplied function.  When updates (method
 * {@link #accumulate}) are contended across threads, the set of variables
 * may grow dynamically to reduce contention.  Method {@link #get}
 * (or, equivalently, {@link #doubleValue}) returns the current value
 * across the variables maintaining updates.
 *
 * <p>The supplied accumulator function must be side-effect-free.  It
 * may be re-applied when attempted updates fail due to contention
 * among threads. The function is applied with the current value as
 * its first argument, and the given update as the second argument.
 * For example, to maintain a running maximum value, you could supply
 * {@code (x, y) -> (y > x) ? y : x} along with {@code
 * Double.MINIMUM_VALUE} as the identity.  (Class {@link DoubleAdder}
 * provides analogs of the functionality of this class for the common
 * special case of maintaining sums.)
 *
 * <p>This class extends {@link Number}, but does <em>not</em> define
 * methods such as {@code hashCode} and {@code compareTo} because
 * instances are expected to be mutated, and so are not useful as
 * collection keys.
