/**
 * A generator of uniform pseudorandom values applicable for use in
 * (among other contexts) isolated parallel computations that may
 * generate subtasks. Class SplittableRandom supports methods for
 * producing pseudorandom numbers of type {@code int}, {@code long},
 * and {@code double} with similar usages as for class
 * {@link java.util.Random} but differs in the following ways: <ul>
 *
 * <li>Series of generated values pass the DieHarder suite testing
 * independence and uniformity properties of random number generators.
 * (Most recently validated with <a
 * href="http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php"> version
 * 3.31.1</a>.) These tests validate only the methods for certain
 * types and ranges, but similar properties are expected to hold, at
 * least approximately, for others as well.  </li>
 *
 * <li> Method {@link #split} constructs and returns a new
 * SplittableRandom instance that shares no mutable state with the
 * current instance. However, with very high probability, the set of
 * values collectively generated by the two objects has the same
 * statistical properties as if the same quantity of values were
 * generated by a single thread using a single {@code
 * SplittableRandom} object.  </li>
 *
 * <li>Instances of SplittableRandom are <em>not</em> thread-safe.
 * They are designed to be split, not shared, across threads. For
 * example, a {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask
 * fork/join-style} computation using random numbers might include a
 * construction of the form {@code new
 * Subtask(aSplittableRandom.split()).fork()}.
 *
 * <li>This class provides additional methods for generating random
 * streams, that employ the above techniques when used in {@code
 * stream.parallel()} mode.</li>
 *
 * </ul>

    /*
     * Implementation Overview.
     *
     * This algorithm was inspired by the "DotMix" algorithm by
     * Leiserson, Schardl, and Sukha "Deterministic Parallel
     * Random-Number Generation for Dynamic-Multithreading Platforms",
     * PPoPP 2012, but improves and extends it in several ways.
     *
     * The primary update step is simply to add a constant ("gamma")
     * to the current seed, modulo a prime ("George"). However, the
     * nextLong and nextInt methods do not return this value, but
     * instead the results of bit-mixing transformations that produce
     * more uniformly distributed sequences.
     *
     * "George" is the otherwise nameless (because it cannot be
     * represented) prime number 2^64+13. Using a prime number larger
     * than can fit in a long ensures that all possible long values
     * can occur, plus 13 others that just get skipped over when they
     * are encountered; see method addGammaModGeorge. For this to
     * work, initial gamma values must be at least 13.
     *
     * The value of gamma differs for each instance across a series of
     * splits, and is generated using a slightly stripped-down variant
     * of the same algorithm, but operating across calls to split(),
     * not calls to nextSeed(): Each instance carries the state of
     * this generator as nextSplit, and uses mix64(nextSplit) as its
     * own gamma value. Computations of gammas themselves use a fixed
     * constant as the second argument to the addGammaModGeorge
     * function, GAMMA_GAMMA, a "genuinely random" number from a
     * radioactive decay reading (obtained from
     * http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/) meeting the above range
     * constraint. Using a fixed constant maintains the invariant that
     * the value of gamma is the same for every instance that is at
     * the same split-distance from their common root. (Note: there is
     * nothing especially magic about obtaining this constant from a
     * "truly random" physical source rather than just choosing one
     * arbitrarily; using "hotbits" was merely an aesthetically pleasing
     * choice.  In either case, good statistical behavior of the
     * algorithm should be, and was, verified by using the DieHarder
     * test suite.)
     *
     * The mix64 bit-mixing function called by nextLong and other
     * methods computes the same value as the "64-bit finalizer"
     * function in Austin Appleby's MurmurHash3 algorithm.  See
     * http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/wiki/MurmurHash3 , which
     * comments: "The constants for the finalizers were generated by a
     * simple simulated-annealing algorithm, and both avalanche all
     * bits of 'h' to within 0.25% bias." It also appears to work to
     * use instead any of the variants proposed by David Stafford at
     * http://zimbry.blogspot.com/2011/09/better-bit-mixing-improving-on.html
     * but these variants have not yet been tested as thoroughly
     * in the context of the implementation of SplittableRandom.
     *
     * The mix32 function used for nextInt just consists of two of the
     * five lines of mix64; avalanche testing shows that the 64-bit result
     * has its top 32 bits avalanched well, though not the bottom 32 bits.
     * DieHarder tests show that it is adequate for generating one
     * random int from the 64-bit result of nextSeed.
     *
     * Support for the default (no-argument) constructor relies on an
     * AtomicLong (defaultSeedGenerator) to help perform the
     * equivalent of a split of a statically constructed
     * SplittableRandom. Unlike other cases, this split must be
     * performed in a thread-safe manner. We use
     * AtomicLong.compareAndSet as the (typically) most efficient
     * mechanism. To bootstrap, we start off using System.nanotime(),
     * and update using another "genuinely random" constant
     * DEFAULT_SEED_GAMMA. The default constructor uses GAMMA_GAMMA,
     * not 0, for its splitSeed argument (addGammaModGeorge(0,
     * GAMMA_GAMMA) == GAMMA_GAMMA) to reflect that each is split from
     * this root generator, even though the root is not explicitly
     * represented as a SplittableRandom.
